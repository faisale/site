			Just a little curious.

			Hello! I'm Faisal, a third year student pursuing Management Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've always had a knack for figuring out why things work the way they do and how to make them better. Combine that with an interest in math and programming, and you can imagine my delight when I discovered the world of machine learning and data science.<br/><br/>

			From my experience working in a variety of industries, I've observed that the two largest drivers to success are continuous improvement and data-driven solutions. I like to exercise these through my primary areas of interest: Data exploration and predictive analytics.<br/><br/>

			I like to cook, play soccer and the piano. I'm also a member of Toastmasters International &ndash; a public speaking organization &ndash; and love delivering speeches.
