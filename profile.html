			Delivery is key.
		</h1>
		<p>
			That's what I believe. From my experience working in a variety of industries, I've observed that the two largest drivers to success are continuous improvement and data-driven solutions. I like to exercise these through my primary areas of interest: Data exploration and predictive analytics.<br/><br/>

			By the way, I'm Faisal. I'm a third year student pursuing Management Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I've always learned best by doing. Make an attempt, review your results, adjust and repeat!<br/><br/>

			I like to cook, play soccer and the piano. I'm also a member of Toastmasters International &ndash; a public speaking organization &ndash; and love delivering speeches.
