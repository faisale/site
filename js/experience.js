Other projects included developing corpus similarity models and benchmarking the first prototype against competitors (exceeding performance and accuracy).</br></br>I'm proud to say that, as a team, we delivered our first prototype within three months. This was a fantastic internship; I gained first-hand experience working in a fast-paced, startup-like environment by being a part of creating a machine-learning product from scratch."
